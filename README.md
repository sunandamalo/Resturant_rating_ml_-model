# Restaurant Rating Predictor - Machine Learning Project
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This project showcases my journey as a budding data science and machine learning enthusiast. I am excited to present my first machine learning model - a Restaurant Rating Predictor.

# Project Overview

The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict restaurant ratings based on various input features provided by users. These features include the restaurant's location, delivery option availability, table booking option, and the user's rating text.

# Dataset and Preprocessing

For this project, I used the Zomato dataset, obtained from Kaggle, as my primary data source. Before diving into model building, I meticulously preprocessed the data to ensure its quality and relevance.

1. Data Cleaning: I thoroughly examined the dataset, checked for any missing values, and performed descriptive statistics to understand the data better.

2. Handling Null Values: I carefully handled the missing values in columns relevant to my model. I either replaced them with mean or median values to maintain data integrity.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To improve my EDA skills and ensure the columns' relevance to my model, I answered critical questions and visualized the data using Matplotlib. This step helped me decide which data columns to retain or drop for optimal model performance.

4. Feature Engineering: I effectively handled categorical values using both one-hot encoding and label encoding techniques. As a beginner, I leveraged the Pandas get_dummies method to convert countries into binary numbers and retained categories with yes/no responses for easier user input handling.

# Model Development
With a well-prepared dataset and carefully engineered features, I embarked on building my machine learning model.

1. Linear Regression Model: I chose a multivariable Linear Regression model to predict restaurant ratings. The model's equation, y = m1x1 + m2x2 + m3*x3..., where m1, m2, etc., are slopes and x1, x2, etc., are independent variables, with the target variable being the restaurant's rating column.

2. Model Training: Using the LinearRegression class from the sklearn library, I trained my model with the preprocessed data.

3. Model Evaluation: After training, I evaluated the model's performance and found it capable of predicting restaurant ratings with an impressive accuracy of approximately 90%.

# Future Improvements

As a beginner, achieving 90% accuracy is incredibly motivating, but I understand that there is always room for improvement. I am committed to fine-tuning the model, exploring other machine learning algorithms, and incorporating more sophisticated techniques to enhance its accuracy and generalization.

# Deployment and Future Projects

Currently, I haven't deployed the model, but you can find the code and project details on my GitHub account. I am excited to embark on more projects and learn various machine learning algorithms to tackle diverse real-world challenges. My goal is to continue building innovative solutions and make a positive impact in the world through AI and data science.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository. I am open to feedback and collaboration opportunities. Let's keep exploring the fascinating world of data science and machine learning together!
